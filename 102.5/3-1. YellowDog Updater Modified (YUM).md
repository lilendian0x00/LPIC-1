`yum` was **originally developed** as the **Yellow Dog Updater (YUP)**

A tool for **package management** on the Yellow Dog Linux distribution.

Over time, it evolved to manage packages on other **RPM based systems**, such as **Fedora**, **CentOS**, **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** and **Oracle Linux**.



Functionally, it is **similar to the apt utility on Debian-based systems**, being able to search for, **install**, **update** and **remove** packages and **automatically handle dependencies**. yum can be used to **install a single package**, or to **upgrade a whole system** at once.
