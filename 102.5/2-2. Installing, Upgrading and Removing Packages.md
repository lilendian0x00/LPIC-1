**Installation:**
```Bash
$ rpm -i PACKAGENAME
```
Where `PACKAGENAME` is the name of the `.rpm` package you wish to install.

To upgrade the package if a previous version of it is on your system:
```Bash
$ rpm -U PACKAGENAME
```

If there is no previous version of `PACKAGENAME` installed, then **a fresh copy will be installed**. **To avoid this and only upgrade an installed package, use the `-F` option**.
