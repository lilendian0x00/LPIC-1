`rpm` will check if those dependencies are installed on your system, and **will fail to install the package if they are not**. In this case, `rpm` will list what is missing. However **it cannot solve dependencies by itself**.

It is up to the user to find the .rpm packages with the corresponding dependencies and install them. Package managers such as **yum**, **zypper** and **dnf** have tools that can tell **which package provides a specific file**.
