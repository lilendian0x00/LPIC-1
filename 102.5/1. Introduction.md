the most common way to distribute software was a compressed file (usually as a .tar.gz archive) with source code, which you would unpack and compile yourself.

Not everyone had the **resources**, both in time and computing power, to compile large projects like the **Linux kernel** or an **X Server**.

Soon, efforts to standardize a way to distribute these software “packages” grew, and the first package managers were born.

One of those was the **RPM Package Manager** and its corresponding tool (`rpm`), developed by Red Hat. Today, they are widely used not only on **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)** itself, but also on its descendants, like **Fedora**, **CentOS** and **Oracle Linux**, other distributions like **openSUSE** and even other operating systems, like **IBM’S AIX**.

Other package management tools popular on Red Hat compatible distros are **yum (YellowDog Updater Modified)**, **dnf (Dandified YUM)** and **zypper**, which can streamline many of the aspects of the **installation**, **maintenance** and **removal** of packages, making package management much easier.


Despite using the same package format, there are **internal differences between distributions** so a package made specifically for **openSUSE** **might not work on a RHEL system**, and **vice-versa**. When searching for packages, always check for compatibility and try to find one tailored for your specific distribution, if possible.
