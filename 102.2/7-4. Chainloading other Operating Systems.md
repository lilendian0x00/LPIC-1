GRUB Legacy can be used **to load unsupported operating systems**, like Windows, using a process called chainloading.

**GRUB Legacy is loaded first**, and when the corresponding option is selected the bootloader for t**he desired system is loaded**.

A typical entry for chainloading Windows would look like the one below:


```Bash
# Load Windows
title Windows XP
root (hd0,1)
makeactive
chainload +1
boot
```

`makeactive`
	will set a flag indicating that this is an active partition. This only works on DOS primary partitions.

`chainload +1`
	tells GRUB to load the first sector of the boot partition. This is where bootloaders are usually located.

`boot`
	will run the bootloader and load the corresponding operating system.
