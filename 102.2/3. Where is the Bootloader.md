Historically, hard disks on IBM PC compatible systems were partitioned using the MBR partitioning scheme, created in 1982 for IBM PC-DOS (MS-DOS) 2.0.

In this scheme, the **first 512-byte sector** of the disk is called the **Master Boot Record** and **contains** *a table* describing the partitions on the disk (**the partition table**) and also *bootstrap code*, **called a bootloader**.

When the computer is turned on, this very minimal (*due to size restrictions*) bootloader code is loaded, executed and **passes control to a secondary boot loader on disk**, **usually located in a 32 KB space between the MBR and the first partition**, which in turn will load the operating system(s).

On an MBR-partitioned disk, the boot code for GRUB is installed to the MBR. This loads and passes control to a “core” image *installed between the MBR and the first partition*. From this point, GRUB is capable of loading the rest of the needed resources (**menu definitions**, **configuration files** and **extra modules**) from disk.

However, **MBR has limitations on the number of partitions** (originally a **maximum of 4 primary partitions**, later a maximum of 3 primary partitions with **1 extended partition** subdivided into a number of logical partitions) and **maximum disk sizes of 2 TB**.

To overcome these limitations a new partitioning scheme called **GPT (GUID Partition Table)**, **part of the UEFI** (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) standard, was created.


GPT-partitioned disks can be used either with computers with the traditional PC BIOS or ones with UEFI firmware. On machines with a BIOS, the second part of GRUB is stored in a special BIOS boot
partition.

On systems with UEFI firmware, GRUB is loaded by the firmware from the files `grubia32.efi` (for 32-Bit systems) or `grubx64.efi` (for 64-Bit systems) from a partition called the **ESP (EFI System Partition)**.
