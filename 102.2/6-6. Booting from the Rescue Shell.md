In case of a boot failure **GRUB 2 may load a rescue shell**, **a simplified version of the shell we mentioned before**. You will recognize it by the command prompt, which displays as:
`grub rescue>`

The process to boot a system from this shell is almost the same as shown before. However, you will need to **load a few GRUB 2 modules** to make things work.

After finding out which partition is the boot partition (with `ls`, as shown before), use the set `prefix=` command, followed by the full path to the directory containing the GRUB 2 files. Usually `/boot/grub`. In our example:

```Bash
grub rescue> set prefix=(hd0,msdos1)/boot/grub
```

Now, load the modules normal and linux with the `insmod` command:

```Bash
grub rescue> insmod normal
grub rescue> insmod linux
```

Next, set the boot partition with `set root=` as directed before, load the **linux kernel (with linux)**, the **initial RAM disk (initrd)** and try to boot with `boot`.
