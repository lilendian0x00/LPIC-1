The original version of **GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader)**, now known as **GRUB Legacy** was developed in **1995** as part of the GNU Hurd project, and later was **adopted as the default boot loader of many Linux** distributions, **replacing earlier alternatives such as LILO**.

GRUB 2 is a complete rewrite of GRUB aiming to be **cleaner**, **safer**, more **robust**, and **more powerful**.


among the many advantages over GRUB Legacy are **a much more flexible configuration file** (with many more commands and conditional statements, similar to a scripting language), **a more modular design** and **better localization/internationalization**.

There is also support for **themes** and **graphical boot menus** with splash screens, the ability to **boot LiveCD ISOs directly from the hard drive**, **better support for non-x86 architectures**, **universal support for UUIDs** (making it easier to **identify disks and partitions**) and much more.


GRUB Legacy is **no longer under active development** (the last release was 0.97, in **2005**), and today **most major Linux distributions install GRUB 2 as the default boot loader**.

However, you may still find systems using **GRUB Legacy**, so **it is important to know how to use it and where it is different from GRUB 2**.
