### Installing GRUB 2
GRUB 2 can be installed using the `grub-install` utility. If you have a non booting system **you will need to boot using a Live CD or rescue disc**, **find out which is the boot partition for your system**, **mount it** and then **run the utility**.

The **first disk on a system is usually the boot device** and you may need to know whether there is a boot partition on the disk. This can be done with the `fdisk` utility. 

```Bash
$ fdisk -l /dev/sda

Disk /dev/sda: 111,8 GiB, 120034123776 bytes, 234441648 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x97f8fef5

Device     Boot    Start       End   Sectors   Size Id Type
/dev/sda1  *        2048   2000895   1998848   976M 83 Linux
/dev/sda2        2002942 234440703 232437762 110,9G  5 Extended
/dev/sda5        2002944  18008063  16005120   7,6G 82 Linux swap / Solaris
/dev/sda6       18010112 234440703 216430592 103,2G 83 Linux
```

The boot partition is identified with the `*` under the boot column.

Now, create a temporary directory under `/mnt` and mount the partition under it.

```Bash
$ mkdir /mnt/tmp
$ mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/tmp
```

Then run `grub-install`, **pointing it to the boot device** (not the partition) and the directory where the boot partition is mounted. If your system does have a dedicated boot partition, the command is:
```Bash
$ grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/tmp /dev/sda
```

If you are installing to a system **which does not have a boot partition**, but just a `/boot` directory on the root filesystem, point `grub-install` to it. So, the command is:
```Bash 
$ grub-install --boot-directory=/boot /dev/sda
```
