GRUB Legacy **menu entries** and **settings** are stored in the file `/boot/grub/menu.lst`. 

A menu entry has **at least three commands**. The first one, **title**, sets the title of the operating system on the menu screen. The second one, **root, tells GRUB Legacy which device or partition to boot from.**

A simple example follows:

```Bash
# This line is a comment
title My Linux Distribution
root (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/hda1
```

Unlike GRUB 2, in GRUB Legacy both **disks and partitions are numbered from zero**. So, the command `root (hd0,0)` will set the boot partition as the first partition (0) of the first disk (hd0).

You can **omit the root statement** if you **specify the boot device before the path on the kernel command**. The syntax is the same, so:

```Bash
kernel (hd0,0)/vmlinuz root=dev/hda1
```

is equivalent to:

```Bash
root (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/hda1
```

Both will load the file **vmlinuz** from the root directory (`/`) of the **first partition of the first disk** `(hd0,0)`.

The parameter `root=/dev/hda1` **after the kernel command** tells the Linux kernel **which partition should be used as the root filesystem**. This is a **Linux kernel parameter**, **not a GRUB Legacy command**.
