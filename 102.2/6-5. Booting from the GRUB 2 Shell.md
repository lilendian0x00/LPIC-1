You can use the GRUB 2 shell to boot the system in case a **misconfiguration in a menu entry** causes it to fail.

The first thing you should do is find out where the boot partition is. You can do that with the command `ls`, which will show you **a list of the partitions and disks GRUB 2 has found**.

```Bash
grub> ls
(proc) (hd0) (hd0,msdos1)
```

In the example above, things are easy. There is only **one disk (hd0)** with only **one partition** on it: `(hd0,msdos1)`.

The disks and partitions listed will be different in your system. In our example the first partition of `hd0` is called `msdos1` because the disk was partitioned using the **MBR partitioning scheme**. If it were partitioned using **GPT, the name would be gpt1**.

To boot Linux, we need: **a kernel** and **initial RAM disk (initrd)**. Let us check the contents of (hd0,msdos1):

```Bash
grub> ls (hd0,msdos1)/

lost+found/ swapfile etc/ media/ bin/ boot/ dev/ home/ lib/ lib64/ mnt/ opt/ proc/ root/
run/ sbin/ srv/ sys/ tmp/ usr/ var/ initrd.img initrd.img.old vmlinuz cdrom/
```

You can add the `-l` parameter to ls to **get a long listing, similar to what you would get on a Linux terminal**. Use `Tab` to **autocomplete** `disk`, `partition` and `file names`.


Note that we have a **kernel (vmlinuz)** and **initrd (initrd.img)** images right on the root directory. If not, we could check the contents of `/boot` with list `(hd0,msdos1)/boot/`.

Now, set the **boot partition**:
```Bash
grub> set root=(hd0,msdos1)
```

Load the Linux kernel with the linux command, followed by the path to the **kernel** and the `root=` option **to tell the kernel where the root filesystem for the operating system is located**.

1. Boot partition
2. Linux kernel 
3. Root filesystem
4. initrd image

```Bash
grub> linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1
```

Load the `initial` RAM disk with initrd, followed by the full path to the `initrd.img` file:

```Bash
grub> initrd /initrd.img
```

Now, boot the system with `boot`.

```Bash
grub> boot
```
