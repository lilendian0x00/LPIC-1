If you see **just a countdown**, but not a menu, press `Shift` to bring up the menu.

To edit an option, select it with the arrow keys and press `E`. This will show an editor window with the contents of the `menuentry` associated with that option, as defined in `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`.

After editing an option, type `Ctrl + X` or `F10` to boot, or `Esc` to return to the menu.

To enter the GRUB 2 shell, press `C` on the menu screen (or `Ctrl + C`) on the editing window). You will see a command prompt like this: `grub >`

Type `help` to see a list of all available commands, or press `Esc` to exit the shell and return to the menu screen.

Remember this menu will not appear if `GRUB_TIMEOUT` is set to `0` in `/etc/default/grub`.
