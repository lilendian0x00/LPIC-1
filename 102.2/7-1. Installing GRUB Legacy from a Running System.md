To install GRUB Legacy **on a disk** from a **running system** we will use the `grub-install` utility. The basic command is `grub-install DEVICE` where `DEVICE` is the disk where you wish to install GRUB Legacy. An example would be `/dev/sda`.

```Bash
# grub-install /dev/sda
```

Note that you need to specify the **device where GRUB Legacy will be installed**, like `/dev/sda/`, **not the partition** as in `/dev/sda1`.

By default GRUB will copy the needed files to the `/boot` directory on the specified device. If you wish to copy them to another directory, use the `--boot-directory=` parameter, followed by the **full path to where the files should be copied to**.
