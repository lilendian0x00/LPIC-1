If you cannot boot the system for some reason and need to reinstall GRUB Legacy, you can do so from the **GRUB shell** on a **GRUB Legacy boot disk**.

## Instructions
1. Set the boot device and partition which contains the `/boot` directory. (e.g. `root (hd0,0)`)
2. Install GRUB Legacy to MBR using `setup` cmd.
3. Reboot the system

From the GRUB shell (type c at the boot menu to get to the` grub>` prompt), the first step is to **set the boot device**, which contains the `/boot` directory. For example, if this directory is in the first partition of the first disk, the command would be:

```Bash
grub> root (hd0,0)
```

If you do not know which device contains the `/boot` directory, you can ask GRUB to search for it with the `find` command, like below:

```Bash
grub> find /boot/grub/stage1
Â (hd0,0)
```

Then, set the boot partition as instructed above and use the `setup` command to install GRUB Legacy to the MBR and copy the needed files to the disk:

```Bash
grub> setup (hd0)
```

When finished reboot the system and it should boot normally.
