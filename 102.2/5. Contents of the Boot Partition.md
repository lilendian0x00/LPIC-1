The contents of the `/boot` partition may vary with **system architecture** or the **boot loader in use**. but on a x86-based system you will usually find the files below.

### Config file
This file, usually called `config-VERSION` (see example above), **stores configuration parameters** for the Linux kernel. This file is **generated automatically when a new kernel is compiled or installed** and **should not be directly modified** by the user.

### System map
This file is a **look-up table matching symbol names** (like **variables** or **functions**) **to their corresponding position in memory**. This is useful **when debugging a kind of system failure known as a kernel panic**, as it allows the user to know which variable or function was being called when the failure occurred. Like the config file, the name is usually `System.map-VERSION` (e.g. `System.map-4.15.0-65-generic`).

### Linux kernel
This is the operating system **kernel proper**. The name is usually `vmlinux-VERSION` (e.g. `vmlinux-4.15.0-65-generic`). You may also find the name `vmlinuz` instead of `vmlinux`, the `z` at the end meaning that the file has been compressed.

### Initial RAM disk
This is usually called `initrd.img-VERSION` and contains a minimal root file system loaded into a RAM disk, containing utilities and kernel modules needed so the kernel can mount the real root filesystem.

### Boot loader related files
On systems with GRUB installed, these are usually located on `/boot/grub` and include the **GRUB configuration file** (`/boot/grub/grub.cfg` for GRUB 2 or `/boot/grub/menu.lst` in case of **GRUB Legacy**), modules (in `/boot/grub/i386-pc`), translation files (in `/boot/grub/locale`) and fonts (in `/boot/grub/fonts`).
