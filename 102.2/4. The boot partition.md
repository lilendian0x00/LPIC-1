the files necessary for the boot process are usually stored on a boot partition. mounted under the root file system and colloquially referred to as `/boot`.


A boot partition is **not needed on current systems**, as boot loaders such as GRUB can usually mount the root file system and look for the needed files inside a `/boot` directory but **it is good practice as it separates the files needed for the boot process from the rest of the filesystem**.


This partition is usually **the first one on the disk**. This is because the original IBM PC BIOS addressed disks using Cylinders, Heads and Sectors (CHS), with a maximum of **1024 cylinders**, 256 heads and 63 sectors, resulting in a maximum disk size of 528 MB (504 MB under MS DOS). This means that anything past this mark would not be accessible, unless a different disk addressing scheme (like LBA, Logical Block Addressing) was used.

So for maximum compatibility, the `/boot` partition is usually **located at the start of the disk and ends before cylinder 1024 (528 MB)**.  ensuring that the machine will always be able to load the kernel. The recommended size for this partition on a current machine is **300 MB**.

Other reasons for a separate `/boot` partition are **encryption** and **compression** since some methods may not be supported by GRUB 2 yet, or if you need to have the system root partition (`/`) formatted using an unsupported file system. Most of these are named with a `-VERSION` suffix, where `-VERSION` is the **version of the corresponding Linux kernel**.


a configuration file for the Linux kernel version `4.15.0-65-generic` would be called `config-4.15.0-65-generic`.
