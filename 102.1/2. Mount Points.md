Before a filesystem can be accessed on Linux it needs to be mounted. This means *attaching the filesystem to a specific point* in your systemâ€™s directory tree, called a **mount point**.

The mount point *must exist before mounting the filesystem*.

You **cannot** mount a partition under `/mnt/userdata` if this directory does not exist.

However if the directory does exist and **contains files**, those files will be *unavailable* **until you unmount the filesystem**. If you list the contents of the directory, you will see the **files stored on the mounted filesystem**, **not the original contents of the directory**.

Filesystems can be mounted anywhere you want. 

Traditionally, `/mnt` was the directory under which **all external devices would be mounted** and a number of pre-configured anchor points for common devices, like **CD-ROM** drives (`/mnt/cdrom`) and **floppy disks** (`/mnt/floppy`) existed under it.

This has been superseded by `/media`, which is now the **default mount point for any user- removable media** (e.g. **external disks**, **USB flash drives**, **memory card readers**, **optical disks**, etc.) connected to the system.

On most modern Linux distributions and desktop environments, removable devices are automatically mounted under `/media/USER/LABEL` when connected to the system, where `USER` is the **username** and `LABEL` is the **device label**.

That being said, whenever you need to **manually mount a filesystem**, it is good practice to mount it under `/mnt`
