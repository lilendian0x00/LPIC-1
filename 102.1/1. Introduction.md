relationship between disks, partitions, filesystems and volumes.


**partition:** logical subset of the physical disk, like a *logical “fence”*. Partitioning is a way to “compartmentalize” information stored on the disk, separating, for example, operating system data from user data.

Every disk needs at least **one partition**.

information about them is stored in a **partition table**.

This table includes information about the *first* and *last* **sectors** of the partition and **its type**, as well as **further details on each partition**.

Inside each partition there is a **filesystem**.

**filesystem:** describes the way the information is actually stored on the disk. This information includes *how the directories are organized*, what is the *relationship between them*, *where is the data for each file*, etc.

**Partitions cannot span multiple disks**. But using the **Logical Volume Manager (LVM) multiple partitions can be combined, even across disks, to form a single logical volume.**

#### Advantages of using  LVM:
Logical volumes abstract the *limitations of the physical devices* and let your work with *“pools”* of disk space that can be *combined* or *distributed* in a much more *flexible way* than traditional partitions.

LVM is useful in situations where you would need to **add more space to a partition without having to migrate the data to a larger device**.
