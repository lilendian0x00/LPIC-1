On Linux, there are some directories that you should consider keeping on separate partitions.

There are many reasons for this: for example, by keeping bootloader-related files (stored on `/boot`) on a boot partition, **you ensure your system will still be able to boot in case of a crash on the root filesystem.**

Keeping userâ€™s personal directories (under `/home`) on a separate partition *makes it easier to reinstall the system without the risk of accidentally touching user data*.

Keeping data related to a *web* or *database* server (usually under `/var`) on a *separate partition* (or even a separate disk) makes system administration easier should you need to add more disk space for those use cases.

keep the root filesystem (`/`) on a **speedy SSD** unit, and **bigger directories** like `/home` and `/var` on *slower hard disks*.
