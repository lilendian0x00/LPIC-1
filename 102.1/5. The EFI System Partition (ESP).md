sed by machines based on the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) to store **boot loaders** and **kernel images** for the operating systems installed.

This partition is formatted in a **FAT-based** filesystem.

On a disk partitioned with a **GUID Partition Table** it has a globally unique identifier of `C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B`.

If the disk was formatted under the **MBR partitioning** scheme the **partition ID** is `0xEF`

On machines running Microsoft Windows this partition is usually **the first one** on the disk although this is **not required**.

The ESP is created (or populated) by the operating system upon installation, and on a Linux system is mounted under `/boot/efi`
