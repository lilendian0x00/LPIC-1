This directory contains “**variable data**”, or files and directories the system must be able to write to during operation.

**system logs** (`/var/log`)
**temporary files** (`/var/tmp`) 
**cached application data** (`/var/cache`)


`/var/www/html` is also the default directory for the data files for the Apache Web Server and `/var/lib/mysql` is the default location for database files for the MySQL server.

**Reason to put `/var` in another separate partition:** 
A misbehaved process may write data until there is no free space left on the filesystem. If `/var` is under `/` this may trigger a **kernel panic** and **filesystem corruption**, causing a situation that is difficult to recover from.

But if `/var` is kept under a separate partition, the root filesystem will be unaffected.
