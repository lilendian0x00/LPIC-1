contains files used by the bootloader to load the operating system.

the bootloader is usually **GRUB2** or, on older systems, **GRUB Legacy**.

usually **mounted** under `/boot` and its files are **stored** in `/boot/grub`.

Technically **a boot partition is not needed**, since **in most cases GRUB can mount the root partition (`/`)** and **load the files from a separate `/boot` directory**.

However, **a separate boot partition** may be:
1. desired for safety (ensuring the system will boot even in case of a root filesystem crash)
2. if you wish to use a filesystem which the bootloader cannot understand in the root partition. 
3. if it uses an unsupported encryption or compression method.

The **boot partition** is usually **the first partition on the disk**. This is because the original IBM PC BIOS addressed disks using cylinders, heads and sectors (CHS), with a maximum of 1024 cylinders, 256 heads and 63 sectors, resulting in a maximum disk size of 528 MB (504 MB under MS DOS)

This means that anything past this mark would **not be accessible on legacy systems**, unless a different disk addressing scheme (like Logical Block Addressing, LBA) was used

So for maximum compatibility, the **boot partition is usually located at the start of the disk and ends before cylinder 1024 (528 MB)**, ensuring that no matter what, the machine will be always
able to load the kernel.

Since the boot partition **only stores the files needed by the bootloader**, the initial RAM disk and kernel images, it can be quite small by todayâ€™s standards. A good size is around 300 MB.
