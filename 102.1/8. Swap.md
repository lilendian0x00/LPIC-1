used to swap memory pages from RAM to disk as needed.

This partition needs to be of a **specific type**, and set-up with a **proper utility** called `mkswap` before it can be used.

The swap partition cannot be mounted like the others, meaning that **you cannot access it like a normal directory and peek at its contents**.

A system can have **multiple swap partitions** (though this is uncommon) and Linux also supports the use of **swap files instead of partitions**, which can be useful to **quickly increase swap space** when needed.

The old rule from the early days of Linux (“**twice the amount of RAM**”) **may not apply anymore** depending on how the system is being used
and the amount of physical RAM installed.

Amount of RAM | Recommended Swap Size |  //// Hibernation

< 2 GB of RAM   |     2x       | 3x
2-8 GB of RAM   | Equal to the amount of RAM | 2x 
8-64 GB of RAM |         At least 4 GB                  | 1.5x 
\> 64                     |         At least 4 GB                  | Not recommended

the amount of swap can be workload dependent.

f the machine is running a critical service, such as a database, web or SAP server, it is wise to check the documentation for these services (or your software vendor) for a recommendation.
