The references contained in dynamically linked programs are **resolved by the** `dynamic linker` (`ld.so` or `ld-linux.so`) when the program is run. The dynamic linker searches for libraries in a **number of directories.** 

These directories are specified by the **library path**. 

The library path is configured in the `/etc` directory, namely in the file `/etc/ld.so.conf` and, **more common nowadays**, in files residing in the `/etc/ld.so.conf.d` **directory**. Normally, the former includes just a single include line for `*.conf` files in the latter:

```Bash
$ cat /etc/ld.so.conf
include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf
```

The `/etc/ld.so.conf.d` directory contains `*.conf `files:

```Bash
$ ls /etc/ld.so.conf.d/
libc.conf  x86_64-linux-gnu.conf
```


These `*.conf` files must include the absolute paths to the shared library directories:

```Bash
$ cat /etc/ld.so.conf.d/x86_64-linux-gnu.conf
# Multiarch support
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
```

The `ldconfig` command **takes care of reading these config files**, **creating the aforementioned set of symbolic links** that help to **locate the individual libraries** and finally of **updating the cache file**
`/etc/ld.so.cache`.

Useful options for `ldconfig` are:

`-v, --verbose`
	Display the library version numbers, the name of each directory, and the links that are created:

```Bash
$ sudo ldconfig -v
/usr/local/lib:
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:
    libnss_myhostname.so.2 -> libnss_myhostname.so.2
    libfuse.so.2 -> libfuse.so.2.9.7
    libidn.so.11 -> libidn.so.11.6.16
    libnss_mdns4.so.2 -> libnss_mdns4.so.2
    libparted.so.2 -> libparted.so.2.0.1
    (...)
```

So we can see, for example, how `libfuse.so.2` is linked to the actual shared object file
`libfuse.so.2.9.7`.

`-p, --print-cache`
	Print the lists of directories and candidate libraries stored in the current cache:
	
```Bash
$ sudo ldconfig -p
1094 libs found in the cache `/etc/ld.so.cache'
    libzvbi.so.0 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libzvbi.so.0
    libzvbi-chains.so.0 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libzvbi-chains.so.0
    libzmq.so.5 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libzmq.so.5
    libzeitgeist-2.0.so.0 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libzeitgeist-
2.0.so.0
    (...)
```

Note how the cache uses the fully qualified soname of the links:

```Bash
$ sudo ldconfig -p |grep libfuse
      libfuse.so.2 (libc6,x86-64) => /lib/x86_64-linux gnu/libfuse.so.2
```


If we long list `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfuse.so.2`, we will find the reference to the actual shared object file `libfuse.so.2.9.7` which is stored in the same directory:


```Bash
$ ls -l /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfuse.so.2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 16 Aug 21  2018 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfuse.so.2 ->
libfuse.so.2.9.7
```

Since it requires **write access** to `/etc/ld.so.cache` (owned by **root**), you must either be **root** or use **sudo** to **invoke `ldconfig`**.

In addition to the configuration files described above, the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable can be used to add new paths for shared libraries temporarily. It is made up of a colon-separated (`:`) set of directories where libraries are looked up. To add, for example, `/usr/local/mylib` to the library path in the current shell session, you could type:

```Bash
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/mylib
```

Now you can check its value:

```Bash
$ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/usr/local/mylib
```

To add `/usr/local/mylib` to the library path in the current shell session and have it exported to all child processes spawned from that shell, you would type:

```Bash
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/mylib
```

To remove the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable, just type:

```Bash
$ unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

To make the changes permanent, you can write the line:
```Bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/mylib
```

in one of Bash’s initialization scripts such as `/etc/bash.bashrc` or `~/.bashrc`.

`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is to shared libraries what `PATH` is to executables. For more information about environment variables and shell configuration, refer to the respective lessons.
