The name of a **Shared library**, also known as soname, follows a pattern which is made up of three elements:
• **Library name** (normally prefixed by lib)
• **so** (which stands for “shared object”)
• **Version number** of the library
Here an example: `libpthread.so.0`


**Static library** names end in `.a`, e.g. `libpthread.a`.


Because the files containing shared libraries must be available when the program is executed, most Linux systems contain shared libraries. Since static libraries are only required in a dedicated file when a program is linked, they might not be present on an end user system.


**glibc (GNU C library)** is a good example of a shared library.

On a Debian GNU/Linux 9.9 system, its file is named libc.so.6. Such rather general file names are normally symbolic links that point to the actual file containing a library, whose name contains the exact version number.

```Bash
$ ls -l /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 12 feb  6 22:17 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 -> libc-2.24.so
```

This pattern of referencing shared library files named by a specific version by more general file names is common practice.


Other examples of shared libraries include:

**libreadline** (which allows users to edit command lines as they are typed in and includes support for both Emacs and vi editing modes)

**libcrypt** (which contains functions related to encryption, hashing, and encoding)

**libcurl** (which is a multiprotocol file transfer library)


Common locations for shared libraries in a Linux system are:
• `/lib`
• `/lib32`
• `/lib64`
• `/usr/lib`
• `/usr/local/lib`

The concept of shared libraries is not exclusive to Linux. In **Windows**, for example, they are called **DLL** which stands for dynamic linked libraries.
