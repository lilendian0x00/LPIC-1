When a package is installed there is a configuration step called **post-install** where a script runs to set-up everything needed for the software to run such as **permissions**, **placement** of configuration files, etc. This may also ask some questions of the user to **set preferences** on how the software will run.


Sometimes, due to a corrupt or malformed configuration file, you may wish to restore a package’s settings to its “fresh” state. Or you may wish to change the answers you gave to the initial configuration questions. To do this run the `dpkg-reconfigure` utility, followed by the package
name.

1. It back-up the old configuration files
2. unpack the new ones in the correct directories and run the `post-install` script provided by the package, as if the package had been installed for the first time. 

Try to reconfigure the `tzdata` package with the following example:

`dpkg-reconfigure tzdata`
