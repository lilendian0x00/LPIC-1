A utility called `apt-file` can be used to perform more operations in the package index, 
1. listing the contents of a package.
2. finding a package that contains a specific file.

`apt-file update`

To **list** the contents of a package, use the `list` parameter followed by the `package name`: 

```Bash
$ apt-file list unrar

unrar: /usr/bin/unrar-nonfree
unrar: /usr/share/doc/unrar/changelog.Debian.gz
unrar: /usr/share/doc/unrar/copyright
unrar: /usr/share/man/man1/unrar-nonfree.1.gz
```

You can **search all packages for a file** using the `search` parameter, followed by the `file name`.

Which package provides a file called `libSDL2.so`, you can **use**:

```Bash
$ apt-file search libSDL2.so

libsdl2-dev: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libSDL2.so
```

The answer is the package `libsdl2-dev`, which provides the file `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libSDL2.so`.

## Arguments of  `apt-file`

1. `list`:
	List all of the contents of the package
1. `search`: 
	See which packages are related to the file you've specified.

The difference between `apt-file` search and `dpkg-query` is that `apt-file search` **will also search uninstalled packages**, while `dpkg-query` can only show files that **belong to an installed package**.
