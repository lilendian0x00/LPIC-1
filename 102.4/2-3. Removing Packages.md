To remove a package, pass the `-r` parameter to dpkg, followed by the package name.

```Bash
dpkg -r unrar
```

The removal operation also **runs a dependency check**, and **a package cannot be removed unless every other package that depends on it is also removed**.

You can pass multiple package names to `dpkg -r`, so they will all be removed at once.

When a package is removed, the corresponding **configuration files are left on the system**. If you want to remove everything associated with the package, use the `-P` (purge) option **instead of** `-r`.

You can **force dpkg** to install or remove a package, even if dependencies are not met, by adding the --force parameter like in:
`dpkg -i --force PACKAGENAME`

However, doing so will most likely **leave the installed package, or even your system, in a broken state**. Do not use `--force` unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing.
