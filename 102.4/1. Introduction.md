the most common way to distribute software was a compressed file (usually a `.tar.gz` archive) with source code, which you would unpack and compile yourself.

However, as the amount and complexity of software grew, the need for a way to distribute pre-compiled software became clear. After all, not everyone had the resources, both in time and computing power, to compile large projects like the Linux kernel or an X Server.

Soon, efforts to standardize a way to distribute these software “packages” grew, and the first package managers were born. These tools made it much easier to **install**, **configure** or **remove** software from a system.

One of those was the Debian package format (`.deb`) and its package tool (**dpkg**). Today, they are widely used not only on Debian itself, but also on its derivatives, like Ubuntu and those derived from it.

Another package management tool that is popular on Debian-based systems is the Advanced Package Tool (`apt`), which **can streamline many of the aspects of the installation**, **maintenance** and **removal** of packages, making it much easier.
