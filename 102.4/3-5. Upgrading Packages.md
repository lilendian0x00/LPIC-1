`apt-get upgrade`

before it run `apt-get update`

To upgrade a single package, just run `apt-get upgrade` followed by the **package name**.

As in `dpkg`, `apt-get` will **first check if a previous version of a package is installed. If so, the package will be upgraded to the newest version available in the repository**.
