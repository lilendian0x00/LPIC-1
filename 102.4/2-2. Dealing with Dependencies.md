a package may depend on others to work as intended.

dpkg will **check if those dependencies are installed** on your system, and will **fail to install the package if they are not**. In this case, dpkg **will list which packages are missing**. It cannot solve dependencies by itself.

It is up to the **user** to find the `.deb` packages with the corresponding
dependencies and install them.
