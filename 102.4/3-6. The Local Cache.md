When a package is installed or update a package, it will (`.deb`) be **stored** in `/var/cache/apt/archives` directory. partially downloaded files are copied to `/var/cache/apt/archives/partial/` dir.


To **reclaim** the space and remove (cache) filled with `.deb` files use `apt-get clean` command.
