To get a list of every package installed on your system, use the `--get-selections` option, as in `dpkg --get-selections`. You can also get a list of every file installed by a specific package by passing the `-L PACKAGENAME` parameter to dpkg, like below:

```Bash
dpkg -L unrar
/.
/usr
/usr/bin
/usr/bin/unrar-nonfree
/usr/share
/usr/share/doc
/usr/share/doc/unrar
/usr/share/doc/unrar/changelog.Debian.gz
/usr/share/doc/unrar/copyright
/usr/share/man
/usr/share/man/man1
/usr/share/man/man1/unrar-nonfree.1.gz
```
