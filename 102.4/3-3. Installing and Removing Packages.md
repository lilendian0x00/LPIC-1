`apt-get install xournal`

`apt-get remove xournal`

Be aware that when installing or removing packages, APT will do **automatic dependency resolution**. 

**Dependency resolution:**
1. Any additional packages needed by the package you are installing will also be installed.
2. That packages that depend on the package you are removing will also be removed. 

```Bash
# apt-get remove p7zip
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  android-libbacktrace android-libunwind android-libutils
  android-libziparchive android-sdk-platform-tools fastboot p7zip p7zip-full
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 8 to remove and 75 not upgraded.
After this operation, 6545 kB disk space will be freed.
Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
```

**When a package is removed the corresponding configuration files are left on the system.**

use the `purge` parameter instead of remove or the remove parameter with the `--purge` option

`apt-get purge p7zip`

`apt-get remove --purge p7zip`
