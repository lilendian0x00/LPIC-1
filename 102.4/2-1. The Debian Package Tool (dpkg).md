The Debian Package (`dpkg`) tool is the **essential utility** to **install**, **configure**, **maintain** and **remove** software packages on Debian-based systems.

The most basic operation is to install a `.deb` package, which can be done with:

```Bash
dpkg -i PACKAGENAME
```

Where `PACKAGENAME` is the name of the `.deb` file you want to install.

Package **upgrades are handled the same** way. **Before installing a package, dpkg will check if a previous version already exists in the system**. If so, the package will be upgraded to the new version. **If not, a fresh copy will be installed**.
