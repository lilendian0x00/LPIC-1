every major Linux distribution offers some form of **service management utility** to control the system.

The **first method** is implemented by the **SysVinit** standard. (System V OR SysV)

The **second method** is implemented by **systemd** and **Upstart**.

Today, systemd based service managers are more often found in most Linux distributions.

**service manager:** Is the first program launched by the kernel during the boot process, so its PID (process identification number) is **always 1**.
