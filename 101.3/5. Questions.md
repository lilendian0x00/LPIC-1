# Guided Exercises

**1. How could the `telinit` command be used to reboot the system?**
`telinit 6`

**2. What will happen to the services related to the file `/etc/rc1.d/K90network` when the system enters runlevel 1?**
Due to the letter `K` in the beginning of the file name, the related services will be stopped.

**3. Using command `systemctl`, how could a user verify if the unit `sshd.service` is running?**
`systemctl is.active sshd.service` or `systemctl status sshd.service` or `systemctl status sshd`


**4. In a systemd based system, what command must be executed to enable activation of the unit `sshd.service` during system initialization?**
`systemctl enable sshd.service`


# Explorational Exercises

**1. In a SysV based system, suppose the default runlevel defined in `/etc/inittab` is 3, but the system always starts in runlevel 1. What is the probable cause for that?**

(1) Probably the command `telinitq q` wasn't executed after changing it.
(2) The parameters 1 or S may be present in the kernelâ€™s parameter list.

**2. Although the file `/sbin/init` can be found in systemd based systems, it is only a symbolic link to another executable file. In such systems, what is the file pointed by `/sbin/init`?**

`/lib/systemd/systemd`

**3. How can the default system target be verified in a systemd based system?**
`systemctl get-default` and the symbolic link `/etc/systemd/system/default.target` will point to the unit file defined
as the default target.

**4. How can a system reboot scheduled with the shutdown command be canceled?**
`shutdown -c`
